- If we have a list with non-unique elements, by using set() we can get the list of unique elements.

- Indendation is key for dividing up code between i.e. normal code and part of a for loop

- Variable definitions inside a function cannot be seen from outside i.e. variables within a function have their function as their scope

- In python3 the order of the dictionary entries are preserved from when they where created
